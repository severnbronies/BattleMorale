# Battle Morale
A video game about overcoming adversity by Alice Casey, Kimberly Grey, Kit Manners, Sam P, and Watson.

## Characters

[PC]
The player character. Unseen throughout, they interact with the NPC through text messages. They are a friend of the NPC, and provides (or fails to provide) emotional support to the NPC throughout the game. 

[NPC]
A non-playable character and the protagonist of the game. They’re going through some tough times, which are manifested in the form of physical puzzles and challenges. They are dependent on the player to provide the emotional fortitude for them to proceed. 

## Gameplay overview

The NPC encounters anxieties and mental insecurities that are manifested as physical challenges. It is implied, but not explicitly, that they are struggling with some challenge in their life (e.g. coming out, transitioning gender, wants to ask out someone). In these situations they approach the player for support via text messages. 

The player can choose to be empathetic and supportive or be honest and frank with the NPC through selecting one of multiple responses. Being too supportive causes the NPC to become burdened with anxiety from expectations of success, being too frank causes them to struggle with depression and emotional neglect. In either situation, the NPC will give up the fight completely: “Sorry…”

If the player can guide the NPC through all of the challenges, they win.
